# Αρχή ήμισυ παντός

## my promise to you: humane, real, honest,

### humane

we need tech to be humane: no profit, no manipulation, nothing that distort the perception of tech

### real

we need tech to solve real problems,

we need tech to be real and not some artificial algorithm or AI that "disclaimer: the algo/AI may be biased or stated facts may be halucinations"

### honest

if tech is not honest then its just black magic

if tech is honest then its a tool, a aid, a assist, a true addition to your abilities
