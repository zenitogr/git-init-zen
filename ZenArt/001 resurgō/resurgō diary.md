# my first thoughts

## humane

### a walkthrough technology today

for profit,
for agenda,
for control,
for views,
for bragging

for free; free? free how?

### ads

ads actually track behavior

ads actually are shown to you to the highest bider

you keep seeing "relevant" ads but its essentially the category of the highest bider to your viewing data

so you watch comedy?

comedy central is paying loads of money to youtube/instagram/facebook to show you their ad

#### they know

the advertisers know you are yound or old

what gender you are

what category of content you watch

etc etc etc

the ad you see is proof they target you based on who you are

thats inhumane

that doesnt benefit you

you see an ad that is "relevant" to you

but the truth is its more annoying

like you play games?

you see everywhere ad about war thunder and ivory

but you play call of duty? why would you play war thunder or ivory?

and they keep showing that ad

until you say fuck it; I will try it...

#### what ads want from you

they just want you to download the app

they just want that 100M+ download moniker in the app store for their app

they dont want you to play the game, they just want you to download it once

#### why do they care for a download of their app

with the 100M+ moniker in the app store:

poeple with no control over their addictions will download it cause "it's popular"

then because they have no control over their addictions

they feel like it matters to be good at this game and beat the opponents

and the only way to do that is by spending all of your money into that game

even if the game has only 100 active players

all of those 100 active players spend all their money to keep ahead of the other 100 active players!!!

## that's why we need humane tech

I will start with the basic thing that is missing in social sphere

## a humane social network

our perception of sociaty is based on social networks;

riddled with ads or for profit with subscriptions and paid content creators

all for the views all for the likes all for manipulating sociaty

## let's make the start!
