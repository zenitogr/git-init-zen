# “to rise again, spring up anew”

based on the definition of [resource - wiktionary - english](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/resource#English)

was looking the general term of resources -> resource -> found out about its root in latin resurgō (“to rise again, spring up anew”)

thats what I am trying to create. I want my work to help humanity rise again, spring up anew!

from my point of view, a computer geek, a passionate tech dude, I want technology to help us overcome the lag we have against anything new or complicated beyond our understanding!

like the brain with its complicated nature and scientists' race to understand it but fail again and again,

more so the digital brain of one's and zero's

we created them, we know how they work,

but by sheer complexity of their ingenious design,

its all hidden behind a nice interface or nice sound or haptic feedback...


## resurgō

### to rise again:

yes we have fallen as a sociaty in front of this new marvel that works like magic!

we need to rise again, in control of our digital companions, our digital assistants, and our experience of a screen that can change colors in milliseconds and display hundreds of frames per second

the magic of the keyboard and the touch screen, where one button or touch or combination of keystrokes and multitouch and the smooth movement of the mouse and the swiping; oh the swiping!

the swiping is magic in my little neaterdal brain.

and dont get me started with neuralink and controling the digital realm buy thinking... that is just unreal...

what brain to computer interface can allow or can bring is like opening the pandora box...

### spring up anew

we need to tame the digital lions and conquer as a sociaty the new tech

my goal is to create tech that empowers sociaty and the individual to actually be healthy and use technology like any other tool:


## my promise to you: humane, real, honest,

### humane

we need tech to be humane: no profit, no manipulation, nothing that distort the perception of tech

### real

we need tech to solve real problems,

we need tech to be real and not some artificial algorithm or AI that "disclaimer: the algo/AI may be biased or stated facts may be halucinations"

### honest

if tech is not honest then its just black magic

if tech is honest then its a tool, a aid, a assist, a true addition to your abilities

## the end
